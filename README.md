# Simple "hello world" using NodeJS

I like to use nodemon to run Node apps, so you'll first want to install that:  
`npm g i nodemon`  

After that, type `nodemon hellonode.js --watch hellonode` from this root directory, then head over to http://127.0.0.1:3000/ in your browser.  

You could also just `curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/` and see the results from your terminal of choice.
